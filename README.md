#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
For this documentation I provided information for the best architecture for our web hosting operating platform very well. I went into detail of the structure of the architecture of the windows operating platform.


#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
During the process of working through the design document knowing what tools that would be best suitable for the requirements of the application made it easier to develop the code for the gaming app. Also knowing the end goal of the gaming app permitted easier code development. The design document is a guideline to use when developing the code.


#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definitely choose to revise my evaluation more, in order to provide more factual information surrounding each operating platform with its strengths and weaknesses. I would like to add more improvements to the pros and cons. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs by recognizing the requirements and identifying the correct tools. It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing software so that we don't spend precious time working on something that does not satisfy the requirements of the user.   


#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I took a structured approach and stuck to the design document for designing the software. In the future, I will make sure I use the design documentation and make sure to identify what the user and the client needs in order to design a similar software.
